Implement a module to control the ISSI IS42S16160G-7 SDRAM (16Mbit x 16 data bit bus, 32 megabytes) for De0 Nano. The module provides a simple host interface for reading and writing operations, supports SDRAM initialization and automatic refresh, and coordinates timing between the host and SDRAM.
Module name:
sdram_controller
Input ports:
/* HOST INTERFACE /
wr_addr[HADDR_WIDTH-1:0]: Address for writing operations (HADDR_WIDTH = BANK_WIDTH + ROW_WIDTH + COL_WIDTH).
wr_data[15:0]: 16-bit data to be written to SDRAM.
wr_enable: Write enable signal; on positive clock edge, wr_addr and wr_data are latched.
rd_addr[HADDR_WIDTH-1:0]: Address for reading operations.
rd_enable: Read enable signal; on positive clock edge, rd_addr is latched.
rst_n: Active-low reset signal; triggers SDRAM initialization process when asserted.
clk: Clock input (133MHz by default) for synchronization.
/ SDRAM SIDE */
data_in[15:0]: 16-bit data input from SDRAM (for read operations).

Output ports:
/* HOST INTERFACE /
rd_data[15:0]: 16-bit read data output; available a few clocks after rd_enable and address latching.
rd_ready: Signal indicating read data is available on rd_data.
busy: Signal indicating the controller is busy (cannot accept new commands).
/ SDRAM SIDE */
addr[12:0]: Address bus to SDRAM.
bank_addr[1:0]: Bank address bus to SDRAM.
data_out[15:0]: 16-bit data output to SDRAM (for write operations).
data_oe: Data output enable signal (controls direction of data bus).
clock_enable: Clock enable signal for SDRAM.
cs_n: SDRAM chip select (active-low).
ras_n: SDRAM row address strobe (active-low).
cas_n: SDRAM column address strobe (active-low).
we_n: SDRAM write enable (active-low).
data_mask_low: Low-byte data mask signal.
data_mask_high: High-byte data mask signal.

Implementation:

Basic Configuration: Supports 133MHz clock and CAS latency 3 by default; no burst operation support.
Host Interface:
Write operation: When wr_enable is high, wr_addr and wr_data are latched on positive clk edge; data is written to SDRAM after a few clocks.
Read operation: When rd_enable is high, rd_addr is latched on positive clk edge; read data becomes available on rd_data a few clocks later, with rd_ready asserted.
busy signal is high during operations (initialization, read, write, refresh) to block new commands.
SDRAM Control:
Initialization: Triggered by rst_n; executes a sequence (precharge, refresh, mode register load) to prepare SDRAM for operation.
Refresh: Automatically performs refresh operations at intervals (calculated as CYCLES_BETWEEN_REFRESH) to maintain data integrity.
Command Generation: Generates SDRAM commands (precharge, refresh, read, write, etc.) based on internal state, controlling addr, bank_addr, and control signals (cs_n, ras_n, etc.).
State Management: Uses state machine to handle idle, initialization, refresh, read, and write states, ensuring correct timing and operation sequence.
