Implement a module to control the ISSI IS42S16160G-7 SDRAM (16Mbit x 16 data bit bus, 32 megabytes) for De0 Nano. The module provides a simple host interface for reading and writing operations, supports SDRAM initialization and automatic refresh, and coordinates timing between the host and SDRAM.
Module name:
sdram_controller
Input ports:
/* HOST INTERFACE /
wr_addr[HADDR_WIDTH-1:0]: Address for writing operations.
wr_data[15:0]: 16-bit data to be written to SDRAM.
wr_enable: Write enable signal
rd_addr[HADDR_WIDTH-1:0]: Address for reading operations.
rd_enable: Read enable signal
rst_n: Active-low reset signal
clk: Clock input
/ SDRAM SIDE */
data_in[15:0]: 16-bit data input from SDRAM

Output ports:
/* HOST INTERFACE /
rd_data[15:0]: 16-bit read data output
rd_ready: Signal indicating read data is available on rd_data.
busy: Signal indicating the controller is busy (cannot accept new commands).
/ SDRAM SIDE */
addr[12:0]: Address bus to SDRAM.
bank_addr[1:0]: Bank address bus to SDRAM.
data_out[15:0]: 16-bit data output to SDRAM 
data_oe: Data output enable signal 
clock_enable: Clock enable signal for SDRAM.
cs_n: SDRAM chip select
ras_n: SDRAM row address strobe
cas_n: SDRAM column address strobe 
we_n: SDRAM write enable
data_mask_low: Low-byte data mask signal.
data_mask_high: High-byte data mask signal.
