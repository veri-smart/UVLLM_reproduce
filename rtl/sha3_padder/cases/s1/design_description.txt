Please act as a professional verilog designer.

Implement a SHA-3 padding module that performs message padding according to the SHA-3 standard. This module buffers input data and applies the required padding when the last block is received.

Module name:  
    padder               
Input ports:
    clk: Clock signal
    reset: Synchronous active high reset signal to initialize the module.
    in[31:0]: 32-bit input data word.
    in_ready: Active high signal indicating that input data is valid and ready.
    is_last: Active high signal indicating that the current input is the last word of the message.
    byte_num[1:0]: 2-bit signal indicating the number of valid bytes in the last word.
    f_ack: Active high acknowledge signal from the consumer to indicate data has been consumed.
Output ports:
    buffer_full: Active high signal indicating that the internal buffer is full and ready for output.
    out[575:0]: 576-bit padded output block
    out_ready: Active high signal indicating that output data is valid and ready.
