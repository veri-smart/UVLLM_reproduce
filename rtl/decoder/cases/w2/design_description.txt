Module name:
decoder_3to8
Input ports:
    A: 1-bit input, part of the 3-bit binary input for decoding.
    B: 1-bit input, part of the 3-bit binary input for decoding.
    C: 1-bit input, part of the 3-bit binary input for decoding.
    en: 1-bit input, active-high enable signal (en=1 enables decoding, en=0 disables).
Output ports:
    Y7: 1-bit output, part of the 8-bit decoded output (active-low).
    Y6: 1-bit output, part of the 8-bit decoded output (active-low).
    Y5: 1-bit output, part of the 8-bit decoded output (active-low).
    Y4: 1-bit output, part of the 8-bit decoded output (active-low).
    Y3: 1-bit output, part of the 8-bit decoded output (active-low).
    Y2: 1-bit output, part of the 8-bit decoded output (active-low).
    Y1: 1-bit output, part of the 8-bit decoded output (active-low).
    Y0: 1-bit output, part of the 8-bit decoded output (active-low).
Implementation:
The decoder operates combinationally. When the enable signal (`en`) is high, the 3-bit binary input (`in`) is decoded to generate an 8-bit one-hot output (`out`). The output bit corresponding to the binary value of the input is set to 0 (active low), while all other bits are set to 1. For example:
    - If `in = 3'b000`, then `out = 8'b1111_1110`.
    - If `in = 3'b001`, then `out = 8'b1111_1101`.
    - If `in = 3'b010`, then `out = 8'b1111_1011`.
    - ...
    - If `in = 3'b111`, then `out = 8'b0111_1111`.
If the enable signal (`en`) is low, all output bits are set to 1 (inactive state).
