Module name:
tff
Input ports:
clk: 1-bit input, clock signal (triggered on positive edge).
rstn: 1-bit input, active-low reset signal (rstn=0 triggers reset, rstn=1 for normal operation).
t: 1-bit input, control signal of the T flip-flop.
Output ports:
q: 1-bit output (registered output), output state of the T flip-flop.
Implementation:
This module functions as a T flip-flop, which is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal (clk).
When the active-low reset signal rstn is 0 (reset state), the output q is synchronously set to 0 at the positive edge of clk.
When rstn is 1 (normal operation):

If the control signal t is 1, the output q is flipped (q <= ~q) at the positive edge of clk.
If t is 0, the output q remains unchanged (q <= q) at the positive edge of clk.
