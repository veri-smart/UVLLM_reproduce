Module name:
mux_4to1_case
Input ports:
    a[3:0]: 4-bit input, first input data for multiplexing.
    b[3:0]: 4-bit input, second input data for multiplexing.
    c[3:0]: 4-bit input, third input data for multiplexing.
    d[3:0]: 4-bit input, fourth input data for multiplexing.
    sel[1:0]: 2-bit input, selection signal to choose the input data.
Output ports:
    out[3:0]: 4-bit output (registered output), selected data output based on the sel signal.
Implementation:
    This module functions as a 4-to-1 multiplexer with combinational logic, which selects one of the four 4-bit input data (a, b, c, d) to output through the out port according to the 2-bit selection signal sel.

    The selection logic is implemented via a case statement in a combinational always block (triggered by changes in a, b, c, d, or sel):

    When sel is 2'b00, out is assigned to input a.
    When sel is 2'b01, out is assigned to input b.
    When sel is 2'b10, out is assigned to input c.
    When sel is 2'b11, out is assigned to input d.

    The output out is updated immediately when any of the input signals (a, b, c, d) or the selection signal sel changes, realizing real-time data selection.
