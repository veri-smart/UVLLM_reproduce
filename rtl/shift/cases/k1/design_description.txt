Implement a module to realize an 8-bit circular left shift register with load function. The register can load a specified value when enabled, and perform circular left shift operation in each clock cycle when no load operation is performed.
    Module name:
lshift_reg
Input ports:
    clk: Clock input for synchronization
    rstn: Active-low reset signal
    load_val[7:0]: 8-bit data to be loaded into the register.
    load_en: Load enable signal

Output ports:
    op[7:0]: 8-bit output of the register; reflects the current value of the register.
