Implement a simple SDRAM controller for ISSI IS42S16160G-7 SDRAM, designed for basic read and write operations without burst support. The controller handles initialization, refresh cycles, and read/write commands.

Module name:  
    sdram_controller  
                 
Input ports:
    wr_addr: Write address for SDRAM.
    wr_data: 16-bit data to be written to SDRAM.
    wr_enable: Write enable signal to latch address and data for writing.
    rd_addr: Read address for SDRAM.
    rd_enable: Read enable signal to latch address for reading.
    rst_n: Active low reset signal to initialize the SDRAM.
    clk: Clock signal for synchronous operations.

Output ports:
    rd_data: 16-bit data read from SDRAM.
    rd_ready: Signal indicating that read data is available.
    busy: Signal indicating that the controller is busy and cannot accept new commands.
    addr: Address sent to the SDRAM.
    bank_addr: Bank address sent to the SDRAM.
    data_out: 16-bit data output to SDRAM during write operations.
    data_oe: Output enable signal for SDRAM data bus.
    clock_enable: Clock enable signal for SDRAM.
    cs_n: Chip select signal for SDRAM.
    ras_n: Row address strobe signal for SDRAM.
    cas_n: Column address strobe signal for SDRAM.
    we_n: Write enable signal for SDRAM.
    data_mask_low: Data mask for lower byte during write operations.
    data_mask_high: Data mask for upper byte during write operations.

Implementation:
1. The controller initializes the SDRAM by executing a sequence of commands, including precharge, refresh, and mode register setup.
2. During normal operation, the controller handles read and write commands:
    - For write operations, the address and data are latched, and the data is sent to the SDRAM with appropriate control signals.
    - For read operations, the address is latched, and the data is retrieved from the SDRAM after a few clock cycles.
3. The controller includes a refresh mechanism to ensure data integrity in the SDRAM. Refresh commands are issued periodically based on a refresh counter.
4. The state machine manages the controller's operation, transitioning between states such as IDLE, INIT, REFRESH, READ, and WRITE based on input signals and internal counters.
5. The `busy` signal indicates when the controller is processing a command and cannot accept new requests.
