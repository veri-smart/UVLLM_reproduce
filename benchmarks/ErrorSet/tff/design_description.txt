Implement a T flip-flop module that toggles its output on every positive clock edge when the toggle input is high.

Module name:  
    tff               
Input ports:
    clk: Clock input for synchronization.
    rstn: Active-low reset signal.
    t: Toggle input signal.
Output ports:
    q: Output signal of the T flip-flop.

Implementation:
When t is 1, the output q toggles its state on the positive edge of the clock signal. When t is 0, the output q maintains its current state. The rstn signal is an active-low reset that sets the output q to 0 when asserted.
