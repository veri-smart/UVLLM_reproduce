Module name:
decoder_3to8
Input ports:
A: 1-bit input, part of the 3-bit binary input for decoding.
B: 1-bit input, part of the 3-bit binary input for decoding.
C: 1-bit input, part of the 3-bit binary input for decoding.
en: 1-bit input, active-high enable signal (en=1 enables decoding, en=0 disables).
Output ports:
Y7: 1-bit output, part of the 8-bit decoded output (active-low).
Y6: 1-bit output, part of the 8-bit decoded output (active-low).
Y5: 1-bit output, part of the 8-bit decoded output (active-low).
Y4: 1-bit output, part of the 8-bit decoded output (active-low).
Y3: 1-bit output, part of the 8-bit decoded output (active-low).
Y2: 1-bit output, part of the 8-bit decoded output (active-low).
Y1: 1-bit output, part of the 8-bit decoded output (active-low).
Y0: 1-bit output, part of the 8-bit decoded output (active-low).
Implementation:
This module functions as a 3-to-8 decoder. When the active-high enable signal en is 1 (enabled), the 3-bit input (composed of A, B, C) is decoded into an 8-bit output (Y7-Y0) with active-low logic: the output bit corresponding to the 3-bit input value is set to 0 (valid), and all other output bits are set to 1 (invalid). When en is 0 (disabled), all output bits (Y7-Y0) are set to 1 (invalid).
The decoding logic is implemented via combinational continuous assignment: it judges the combination of {en, A, B, C} and outputs the corresponding 8-bit result. For example, when {en, A, B, C} is 4'b1000, the output {Y7,Y6,Y5,Y4,Y3,Y2,Y1,Y0} is 8'b1111_1110 (Y0 is 0, corresponding to 3-bit input 000); when {en, A, B, C} is 4'b1111, the output is 8'b0111_1111 (Y7 is 0, corresponding to 3-bit input 111). When en is 0 (i.e., {en, A, B, C} does not match any of the enabled combinations), the output is 8'b1111_1111.
