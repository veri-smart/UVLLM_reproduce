Implement a module to realize an 8-bit circular left shift register with load function. The register can load a specified value when enabled, and perform circular left shift operation in each clock cycle when no load operation is performed.
    Module name:
lshift_reg
Input ports:
    clk: Clock input for synchronization; operations are triggered on the positive edge.
    rstn: Active-low reset signal; resets the output when asserted (low level).
    load_val[7:0]: 8-bit data to be loaded into the register.
    load_en: Load enable signal; when high, the register loads load_val.

Output ports:
    op[7:0]: 8-bit output of the register; reflects the current value of the register.

Implementation:

    Reset Operation: When rstn is low (reset active), the output op is set to 0.
    Load Operation: When rstn is high (not reset) and load_en is high, op is updated to load_val on the positive edge of clk.
    Circular Left Shift Operation: When rstn is high and load_en is low, a circular left shift is performed on the positive edge of clk:
    Each bit op[i+1] (where i ranges from 0 to 6) is updated to the value of the previous bit op[i].
    The lowest bit op[0] is updated to the value of the original highest bit op[7].
