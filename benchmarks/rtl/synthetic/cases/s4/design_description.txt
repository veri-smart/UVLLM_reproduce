Implement a module with combinational logic and sequential logic operations, which processes multiple input signals and generates corresponding output signals based on specific logic rules.
Module name:
xxxxx
Input ports:
clk: Clock input for synchronization; sequential logic operations are triggered on the positive edge.
rst: Reset signal (active-high); resets sequential output signals when asserted.
a: 1-bit input signal.
b[3:0]: 4-bit input signal.
c[7:0]: 8-bit input signal.
d[9:0]: 10-bit input signal.

Output ports:
e: 1-bit output signal; generated by combinational logic.
f[15:0]: 16-bit sequential output signal; updated on the positive edge of clk.
g[3:0]: 4-bit sequential output signal; updated on the positive edge of clk.
h: 1-bit sequential output signal; updated on the positive edge of clk.

Implementation:

Combinational Logic for e: The output e is generated by the combinational logic expression: e = a + (b[0] * c[2]) ^ d[7].
Sequential Logic for f:
When rst is high (reset active), f is set to 0 on the positive edge of clk.
When rst is low (not reset) and a is high, f is updated to {b, b, c} (concatenation of b, b, and c) on the positive edge of clk.
When rst is low and a is low, f is updated to the result of ({c, c} & {d, 2'b01, b}) multiplied by 3 on the positive edge of clk.
Sequential Logic for g:
When rst is high, g is set to 0 on the positive edge of clk.
When rst is low, g is updated to the value of b on the positive edge of clk.
Sequential Logic for h:
When rst is high, h is set to 0 on the positive edge of clk.
When rst is low, h is updated to the result of a XOR (bitwise OR of b) on the positive edge of clk.
