# Design Description for tate_pairing

## Module Overview
The `tate_pairing` module implements the Tate pairing algorithm, a fundamental operation in pairing-based cryptography. This module computes the pairing of two elliptic curve points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` over a finite field. The result is a cryptographic value used in various applications such as identity-based encryption and digital signatures.

## Input Ports
- `clk`: Clock signal for synchronous operations.
- `reset`: Active-high reset signal to initialize the module.
- `x1`: Coordinate x of the first elliptic curve point (input vector of width `WIDTH+1`).
- `y1`: Coordinate y of the first elliptic curve point (input vector of width `WIDTH+1`).
- `x2`: Coordinate x of the second elliptic curve point (input vector of width `WIDTH+1`).
- `y2`: Coordinate y of the second elliptic curve point (input vector of width `WIDTH+1`).

## Output Ports
- `done`: Single-bit output signal indicating the completion of the pairing computation.
- `out`: Output vector of width `W6+1` representing the computed pairing value.

## Implementation Details
1. **Initialization**:
   - On reset (`reset` is high), all internal registers and outputs are initialized to zero.
   - The module waits for valid inputs to start the computation.

2. **Computation**:
   - The module performs the Tate pairing algorithm in two main stages:
     - **Duursma-Lee Algorithm**: Computes intermediate values based on the input points.
     - **Second Part**: Finalizes the pairing computation using the intermediate results.
   - The computation is pipelined and synchronized with the clock signal (`clk`).

3. **Completion**:
   - The `done` signal is asserted high when the computation is complete.
   - The `out` signal holds the final pairing result.

## Key Features
- Supports synchronous operation with a clock signal.
- Handles reset to initialize the module state.
- Implements the Tate pairing algorithm with pipelined stages for efficient computation.
- Outputs a cryptographic pairing value used in advanced cryptographic protocols.

## Usage
The `tate_pairing` module is designed for use in cryptographic systems requiring efficient pairing computations. It can be instantiated in a Verilog testbench or integrated into larger cryptographic designs.

## Example Instantiation
```verilog
module example;
    reg clk;
    reg reset;
    reg [`WIDTH:0] x1, y1, x2, y2;
    wire done;
    wire [`W6:0] out;

    tate_pairing uut (
        .clk(clk),
        .reset(reset),
        .x1(x1),
        .y1(y1),
        .x2(x2),
        .y2(y2),
        .done(done),
        .out(out)
    );

    initial begin
        clk = 0;
        reset = 1;
        x1 = 0;
        y1 = 0;
        x2 = 0;
        y2 = 0;
        #10 reset = 0;
        // Add test vectors here
    end

    always #5 clk = ~clk;
endmodule
```
